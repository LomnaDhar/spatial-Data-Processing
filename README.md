I have used Tsunami Data 
I have used data from Kaggle and the link is: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/tsunami-dataset

There are 15 fields/variables in this dataset, in which we use ID : Unique to each observation.Year : Year of event, Longitude, Latitude, Tsunami Intensity
I am trying to find, if there is any pattern in the tsunami intensity. If some areas are more prone to high intensity tsunami, so that we can plan to withstand the descruction beforehand.
I used Spatial Autocorrelation to find if some areas often face high intensity tsunami and get the coordinates of that location.
